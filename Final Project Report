We did better than expected regarding sound, textures, and collisions. Because of the framerate differences in the computers, we ran into problems connecting the graphics and physics engines which also created new problems with our block durability and our gameplay in general. We overestimated our time constraints and as such, we did not plan as well for many of the problems that arose and expected to achieve many far-fetched goals. In the future, we will start minimalistically, solving the basic problems the right way, and moving on to more advanced problems afterward.
