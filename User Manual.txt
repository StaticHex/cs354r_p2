When the game starts, you will be placed in a 3d room with a paddle on one side of the room and blocks on the other side of the room, as well as a ball that moves in between. Using the mouse to control the paddle to keep the ball away from your back wall (closest to the camera), you will also aim to destroy the blocks on the other side of the room. The goal is to clear all the blocks that are not metal before running out of lives. Sound and music can be toggled by pressing 'P'. The camera can be moved vertically and horizontally using the arrow keys. There is a display that shows the player's current points and lives. Different sounds are also played for each different material and different textures are also displayed for each material.
